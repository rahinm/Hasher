Hasher
======

Hasher is a simple GUI tool to calculate hash (also known as message digest) of
input data string or the contents of an input using a variety of message digest
algorithms. Input data (direct input, i.e. not as file input) can be expressed
in text format or hex-encoded text format.

You may also calcualte HMAC codes of the input data, entered in the GUI form
(either as text string or hex-encoded string) or the contents of an input file.
The HMAC key can also be expressed as either text format or hex-encoded format.

This tool is inspired by the HashCalc tool from SlavaSoft 
(https://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm) and written in Java for cross-
platform compatibility.
